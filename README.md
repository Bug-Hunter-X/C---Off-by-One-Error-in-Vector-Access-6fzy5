This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when accessing elements of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to accessing an element beyond the vector's valid index range.  This can cause unpredictable behavior, including crashes or incorrect results.  The solution corrects the loop condition to prevent out-of-bounds access.
